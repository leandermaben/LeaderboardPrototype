# The Agent Company Leaderboard
---------------------------------

This is the code for the prototype leaderboard for the Agent Company.

Leaderboard and header related data can be updated in `src/data/leaderboard.json` and `src/data/header.json` when available.

The website mainly contains placeholder values where the actual data can be populated.

The template is adapted from the [SWE-bench](https://github.com/swe-bench/swe-bench.github.io) project and converted to a react app.
